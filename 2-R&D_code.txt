1) The UMAT has been updated since the initial publication, and since it is academic code it may not be
optimize, and some bugs may accour.

2) The UMAT was initialty formulated only for 2D, but extended to 3D. 
But the 3D analysis is not at the moment tested or validated, caution in the final results is advise.

3) By default the code is generated using Implicit Analysis, with the Stabilization Algorithm.
Therefore, when explaining this algorithm please cite https://doi.org/10.3390/app13021155 
For Geometrical Non-Linear Analysis, when using this code, the viscosity parameter should be below 1E-7.

4) Future versions of this UMAT will be posted without warning.

5) The damage evolution has been updated not present in the original manuscript to better simulate the 3D behaviour. 
Last damage formulation is presented in Pre-Print_UMAT_Hassan.pdf
